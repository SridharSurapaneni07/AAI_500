        "As you have learned and practiced in the module 4, Scikit-learn (package name: `sklearn`) is a Python-based toolkit for a wide variety of machine learning methods.  It supports both supervised learning methods such as classification and regression and unsupervised methods such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.  In addition, it provides much of the software infrastructure to enable the construction of machine learning pipelines, supporting activities such as train-test splitting, cross validation, and hyperparameter optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the scikit-learn developer community has prepared rich documentation that not only describes the particular functions supported by the package, but also theoretical background on different machine learning algorithms and their relationship to one another.\n",

        "In this assignment, you will continue to explore scikit-learn functionalities to tackle a popular computer vision challenge to recognize hand-written digits."

You should see in the package description that sklearn in intended to work in the \"tightly-knit world of scientific Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).\"  This is part of what makes a successful ecosystem: higher-level packages implementating more specific functionality such as machine learning are able to rest on top of the infrastructure provided by other more general packages in the ecosystem.\n",

        "You should also notice that `sklearn` is a Python module supporting \"classical machine learning algorithms.\" Machine-learning algorithms have been developed and used for decades, although much of the recent excitement around the field revolves around newer \"deep-learning\" algorithms that use neural networks for their implementation.  While `sklearn` does provide some support for machine learning using neural networks, that is not its primary focus, hence the emphasis on \"classical\" algorithms.  There is no single algorithm or approach that works best for every problem, and one of the strengths of `sklearn` is that it supports the use and comparison of many different algorithms within one consistent and integrated framework.\n"

From the output above, the value of ```digits.target[0]``` is reported to be ```0```.  This means that the first image in the dataset is an example of the digit 0.

        "You should see that ```digits.data``` has shape (1797, 64).  This reflects the fact that for each of the 1797 hand-written images in the dataset, the 8 x 8 image array has been \"flattened\" into a one-dimensional data array of length 64, by concatenating each of the 8 rows one after the other.  (Within numpy, an n-dimensional array can be flattened into a one-dimensional array using the function <code>np.ravel</code>.)  A flattening like this is convenient to be able to feed data into a machine learning algorithm, since we can use the same algorithm for datasets of different dimensions.  No information is lost by this flattening procedure, except for the fact that if we were to plot out the flattened array, we probably would not be able to recognize what digit is encoded. In the code cell below, make a simple line plot using ```plt.plot``` of the one-dimensional data in array <code>digits.data[0]</code> to see what the flattened version of the data looks like."
